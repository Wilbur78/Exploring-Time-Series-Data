# Exploring-Time-Series-Data

Running a series of modelling experiments on time series data, including:

~ Naive model (baseline) \n
~ Model 1: Dense model (window size = 7, horizon = 1)
~ Model 2: Same arch. as model 1 (window size = 30, horizon = 1)
~ Model 3: Same arch. as model 1 (window size = 30, horizon = 7)
~ Model 4: Conv1D
~ Model 5: LSTM
~ Model 6: Same as model 1 (but with multivariate data)
~ Model 7: N-BEATS algorithm (from https://arxiv.prg/pdf/1905.10437.pdf)
~ Model 8: Ensemble (multiple models stacked together)
~ Model 9: Future prediction model
~ Model 10: same as model 1 (but with turkey data introduced)
