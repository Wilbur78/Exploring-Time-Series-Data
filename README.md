# Exploring-Time-Series-Data

Running a series of modelling experiments on time series data, including:

Naive model (baseline), Dense model (window size = 7, horizon = 1), same arch. as Dense model (window size = 30, horizon = 1), same arch. as Dense model (window size = 30, horizon = 7), Conv1D, LSTM, same as Dense (but with multivariate data), N-BEATS algorithm (from https://arxiv.prg/pdf/1905.10437.pdf), ensemble (multiple models stacked together), future prediction model, and same as Dense model (but with turkey data introduced).
